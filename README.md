These are the files for my interactive resume. Purpose is to show basic competency in HTML, CSS, JS and Jquery. Please feel free to browse!

The index.html will show basic HTML understanding, styles.css for css, and resumeBuilder.js for javascript and Jquery understanding, with a bit of JSON towards the end of the document. 

helper.js contains variables with stored html code, which will be used within resumeBuilder.js.

This project is still a work in progress, but I wanted to put it out here for anyone interested to see what I can currently do!
