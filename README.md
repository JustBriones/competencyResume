These are the files for my interactive resume. Purpose is to show basic competency in HTML, CSS, JS and Jquery. Please feel free to browse!

The index.html will show basic HTML understanding, styles.css for css, and resumeBuilder.js for javascript and Jquery understanding, with a bit of JSON towards the end of the document. 

Helper.js contains variables with stored html code, which will be used within resumeBuilder.js.

Why use JQuery for a resume? Because I want to keep adding skills/experience to my resume! I'll be much easier to just add to my created objects rather than continuously editing the index.html file. Jquery was used to append/prepend to the index.html file.
